        Team Trees (stylized as #TEAMTREES) is a collaborative fundraiser that raised 20 million U.S. dollars before the start of 2020 to plant 20 million trees. The initiative was started by American YouTubers MrBeast and Mark Rober, and was mostly supported
        by YouTubers. All donations go to the Arbor Day Foundation, a tree planting organization that pledges to plant one tree for every U.S. dollar donated. The Arbor Day Foundation began planting in January 2020 and plans to end "no later than December
        2022". It is estimated that 23 million trees would take up 210 km2 (81 sq mi) of land, absorb around 1.6 million tons of carbon and remove 116 thousand tons of pollutants from the atmosphere. As of 29 June 2023, the project has raised $24,438,806,
        exceeding the fundraiser's goal to plant 20 million trees. As anticipated, more than 20 million trees have been planted.
